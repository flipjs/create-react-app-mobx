# create-react-app + mobx

This is an opinionated MobX boilerplate using create-react-app, with [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/index.html) linting.

The example (Counter) used here was taken from [`create-react-app-mobx`](https://github.com/mobxjs/create-react-app-mobx), and modified it slightly.
